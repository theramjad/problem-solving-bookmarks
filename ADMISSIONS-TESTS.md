This is an **incomplete** list of resources (in no particular order) that I found for the following admissions tests. These exclude the official websites for the admissions tests themselves.

# NSAA (Cambridge)
- [BMAT Section 2 Past Papers](https://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/bmat/preparing-for-bmat/practice-papers/) are very similar to the first section in the NSAA.
- [ENGAA Past Papers](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/engineering) (found under *Entry Requirements*) have a similar style of maths and physics related questions in both sections. You can find some worked solutions for them [here](http://www.engineeringadmissionsassessment.com/).

# PAT (Oxford)
- [Oxford PAT Wordpress](https://oxfordpat.wordpress.com/) has a excellent selection of solutions for past papers.
