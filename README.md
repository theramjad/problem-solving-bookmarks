This is an **incomplete** set of lists that I am creating for GCSE and A-level students who wish to improve their problem solving skills. Feel free to bookmark this page (with today's date to compare to last updated) and come back to it regularly to see any changes.

# All Levels

I would highly recommend checking the relevant sections of the [Art of Problem Solving Forums](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community) because there is so much good stuff.

# GCSE

You can find my GCSE problem-solving recommendations [here](https://github.com/RehmanAmjad/problem-solving-bookmarks/blob/master/GCSE.md).

# A-level

You can find my A-level problem-solving recommendations [here](https://github.com/RehmanAmjad/problem-solving-bookmarks/blob/master/A-LEVEL.md). If you want resources more relevant to some admissions tests, look at my list [here](https://github.com/RehmanAmjad/problem-solving-bookmarks/blob/master/ADMISSIONS-TESTS.md).
